# Brain-Stroke-Data-Analysis
This repository contains the code and documentation for a data science project focused on analyzing brain stroke data using Python, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
Overview

Brain strokes are a significant health concern worldwide, leading to serious consequences if not detected and treated promptly. This project aims to analyze a dataset containing information about individuals who have experienced brain strokes. By leveraging data science techniques, we seek to uncover patterns, insights, and potential predictive factors associated with brain strokes.
Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from kaggle. It comprises various attributes related to patients who have experienced brain strokes, including demographic information, medical history, lifestyle factors, and stroke-related metrics. The dataset is anonymized to ensure patient privacy and confidentiality.
